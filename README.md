This is a final project for the machine course (Intelligent Datenanalysis & Machine Learning I) at the university of Potsdam (Master of Science). 
It is a binary classification task for prediction of a Creditworthiness of bank clients. 
The problem setting looked as follows:

Based on the customer records, the credit history, etc., a customer should be classified as creditworthy or unworthy
of credit. It is five times more ‘expensive’ for the bank to rate a customer who is unworthy of credit as creditworthy than vice versa. In addition, not all information is available for all customers. For 1,000 representatively selected customers, the creditworthiness is known. Some features contains missing values.
